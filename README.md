# CosmoHub Documentation

This repository contains the official documentation for [CosmoHub](https://cosmohub.ai), built using [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/).

## Local Development

```
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start the development server
npm start
```

This command starts a local development server and opens up a browser window. Most changes are reflected live without having to restart the server.

## Build

```
npm run build
```

This command generates static content into the `build` directory and can be served using any static contents hosting service.

## Deployment

The documentation is automatically deployed to [docs.cosmohub.ai](https://docs.cosmohub.ai) when changes are pushed to the main branch.
